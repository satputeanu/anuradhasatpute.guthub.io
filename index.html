                    <h2>My Story</h2>
                    <h5>FOR THOSE WHO PREFER A TALE TO A RÉSUMÉ… <br/>(SKIP OVER TO WORK HISTORY IF YOU’RE LOOKING FOR THAT!)</h5>
                    <p>I grew up in a small town in India (Bangalore, to be exact). I was an 80s music lover, a computer enthusiast, and I once owned a Commodore 64 bit computer. Fast-forward through some very nerdy childhood and teenage years and I find myself a young professional working in the silicon hub of India.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>Between 2000-2005, I worked for ITTI, Automated Workflow and ArisGlobal Pvt. Ltd. Here I gained programming experience in Java, web technologies, content management and workflow solutions. I soon progressed to a senior engineer with experience in the supply chain, insurance and pharmaceutical domain. I travelled to Singapore, Vietnam and Indonesia for a Unilver project and worked on some exciting PalmOS applications.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>In 2005, I was lured back in education and went to The University of Sheffield to complete my Masters' studies. I studied Computer Science, an academic discipline that I loved. I also had the good fortune to get offered a position as a Research Assistant in Semantic Web for the Computer Science department, an offer I sadly refused so I could pursue a professional career.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>After graduation, I moved back to India and joined Cognizant as an architect for the Enterprise Search and Retrieval Center-of-Excellence. Here I developed prototypes, authored papers and key architect for implementing enterprise knowledge systems for the enterprise. I then moved on to join Novell ins 2007 and for the two years, I lead a team that worked in their proprietary ZenWorks product for managing enterprise networks. </p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>In 2009, I joined Expedia as a Senior Software Engineer as a lead developer for their landing pages team focusing on on-site conversions. As my career progressed with Expedia, I lead a team accountable for migrating the legacy payment stack to a new checkout experience.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>    
                    From 2016 until 2018, I managed a 36-person retail engineering organization, 5 teams across London, Budapest and Gurgaon India, focused on customer experience, merchandising and growth opportunities for retail. Since 2018, I have been leading a 20-person merchandising engineering organization in London, Szeged, Amaan and Gurgaon including engineering, people managers and technical project managers. The team is responsible for development on a merchandising platform that facilitates a two-sided campaign marketplace to drive growth in direct traffic for Expedia.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>My more than two decades of professional experience have formed me into a leader who is both strategic and technical and squarely focused on people, innovation and growth. I believe building and effectively managing exceptional teams is key, and that what those teams need to succeed is not micromanagement but a clear articulation of vision and goals, and smart decision-making that supports their work.
